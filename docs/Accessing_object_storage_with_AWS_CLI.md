# Accessing the Arbutus object storage with AWS CLI

This page contains instructions on how to set up and access [Arbutus object storage](Arbutus_Object_Storage.md) with the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), one of the [object storage clients](Arbutus_object_storage_clients.md) available for this storage type.

Compared to other object storage clients, AWS CLI has better support for large (>5GB) files and the helpful `sync` command. However, not all features have not been tested.

## Installing AWS CLI

```
pip install awscli awscli-plugin-endpoint

```

## Configuring AWS CLI

Generate an access key ID and secret key

```
openstack ec2 credentials create

```

Edit or create `~/.aws/credentials` and add the credentials generated above

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <access_key>
aws_secret_access_key = <secret_key>

```

Edit `~/.aws/config` and add the following configuration

```
[plugins]
endpoint = awscli_plugin_endpoint

[profile default]
s3 =
  endpoint_url = https://object-arbutus.cloud.computecanada.ca
  signature_version = s3v4
s3api =
  endpoint_url = https://object-arbutus.cloud.computecanada.ca

```

## Using AWS CLI

```
export AWS_PROFILE=default
aws s3 ls <container-name>
aws s3 sync local_directory s3://container-name/prefix

```
