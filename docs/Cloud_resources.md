## Images

Images are provided by Alliance staff on the Alliance Clouds for common Linux distributions (Alma, Debian, Fedora, Rocky, and Ubuntu). New images for these distributions will be added periodically as new releases and updates become available. As releases have an end of life (EOL) after which support and updates are no longer provided, we encourage you to migrate systems and platforms to newer releases in order to continue receiving patches and security updates. Older images for Linux distributions past their EOL will be removed. This does not prevent you from continuing to run a VM with an EOL Linux distribution (though you shouldn't) but does mean that those images will no longer be available when creating new VMs.

For more details about using images see [working with images](Working_with_images.md).
