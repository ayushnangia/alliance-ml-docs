**Vulcan** is a cluster dedicated to the needs of the Canadian scientific Artificial Intelligence community. **Vulcan** is located at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/) and is managed by the University of Alberta and [Amii](https://amii.ca/). It is named after the town [Vulcan, AB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan,_Alberta), located in southern Alberta.

This cluster is part of the Pan-Canadian AI Compute Environment (PAICE).

## Site-specific policies

Internet access is not generally available from the compute nodes. A globally available Squid proxy is enabled by default with certain domains whitelisted. Contact [technical support](Technical_Support.md) if you are not able to connect to a domain and we will evaluate whether it belongs on the whitelist.

Maximum duration of jobs is 7 days.

Vulcan is currently open to all researchers doing research on AI or applying AI methods in their research.

## Access

To access the Vulcan cluster, each researcher must first [request access in CCDB](https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/me/access_services).

If you are a PI and need to sponsor other researchers you will have to add them to your AIP RAP. Follow these steps to manage users:

- Go to the "Resource Allocation Projects" table on the [CCDB home page](https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca).
- Locate the RAPI of your AIP project (with the `aip-` prefix) and click on it to reach the RAP management page.
- At the bottom of the RAP management page, click on "Manage RAP memberships."
- Enter the CCRI of the user you want to add in the "Add Members" section.

## Vulcan hardware specifications

| Nodes | Model | CPU | Cores | System Memory | GPUs per node | Total GPUs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 252 | Dell R760xa | 2 x Intel Xeon Gold 6448Y | 64 | 512 GB | 4 x NVIDIA L40s 48GB | 1008 |

## Storage system

**Vulcan**'s storage system uses a combination of NVMe flash and HDD storage running on the Dell PowerScale platform with a total usable capacity of approximately 5PB. Home, Scratch, and Project are on the same Dell PowerScale system.

| Home space | Location of /home directories. Each /home directory has a small fixed quota . Not allocated via RAS or RAC . Larger requests go to the /project space. Has daily backup |
| --- | --- |
| Scratch space | For active or temporary (scratch) storage. Not allocated. Large fixed quota per user. Inactive data will be purged . |
| Project space | Large adjustable quota per project. Has daily backup. |

## Network interconnects

Nodes are interconnected with 100Gbps Ethernet with RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) enabled.

## Scheduling

The **Vulcan** cluster uses the Slurm scheduler to run user workloads. The basic scheduling commands are similar to the other national systems.

## Software

- Module-based software stack.
- Both the standard Alliance software stack as well as cluster-specific software.
