## Compute clusters

A *general-purpose* cluster is designed to support a wide variety of types of jobs, and is composed of a mixture of different nodes. We broadly classify the nodes as:

- *base* nodes, containing typically about 4GB of memory per core;
- *large-memory* nodes, containing typically more than 8GB memory per core;
- *GPU* nodes, which contain [graphic processing units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit).

All clusters have large, high-performance storage attached. For details about storage, memory, CPU model and count, GPU model and count, and the number of nodes at each site, please click on the cluster name in the table below.
